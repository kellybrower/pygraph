# Pygraph

Simple graph algorithms in Python I implemented for the algorithms and data structures course.

The algorithms include:
- DFS
- BFS
- Topological sort
- Dijkstra's single source shortest path
- Bellman Ford single source shortest path w/ negative weight edges
- Kruskal's minimum spanning tree
- Tarjan's strongly connected components and articulation points
- Hierholzer's algorithm for finding an Eulerian path
